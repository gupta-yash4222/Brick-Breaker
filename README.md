# Brick-Breaker

This is a simple game made in the Unity game engine that uses C# for scripting and is made as a part of the task for the project *Game of Blocks* offered by the Programming Club, IITK. The task was to implement the OOPs concepts, using classes, public & private variables. 

While building a game in Unity, OOPs are extensively used in scripting since we are required to use functions even across the scripts. The scripts that support the game are stored in `/Assets/Scripts`. A significant amount of development of the game has been done through the features provided by Unity, but the core logic of the game i.e., spawning the ball, ball falling out of the paddle, ball hitting the bricks, bricks being broken down, ball hitting the paddle and then moving along a certain direction, lives and score updation, etc. can be seen implemented in the scripts. 


The game is a simple bricks breaking game. Want to play it? Go to the link : [The Game](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/my-new-microgame-3347)
